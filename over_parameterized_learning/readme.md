# A Literature Survey on the Behavior of Overparameterized Neural Networks


## Overview

This is a literature review project focused on understanding the behavior of **overparameterized neural networks** â€” deep learning models where the number of parameters exceeds the number of training examples.

Despite being able to perfectly fit training data, these models often generalize well to unseen data. This surprising behavior challenges traditional views like the bias-variance trade-off and has led to increased interest in phenomena such as **double descent** and **benign overfitting**.


## Project Type

This is a literature survey conducted as part of an academic project for the course CSC - 580 : Machine Learning Theory
